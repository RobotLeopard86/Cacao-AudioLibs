# Cacao Engine Audio Libs Bundle

Just a simple CMake script to build Ogg, Vorbis, FLAC, Opus, and Opusfile from source.  
Licenses for those repositories are found in their subdirectory, the `licenses` folder here, and the `licenses` folder in the Cacao Engine repository.  
The repositories are Git submodules, so clone recursively.
